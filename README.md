# Bittrex-Trader
a small software to see your account on Bittrex.com, manage your orders... will grow in functionality over time, but will stay a way to make money with cryptocurrencies even for non-traders with relatively simple easy (through, as such slow rewarding) ways of doing trades.

# Current Feature :
- Can get the list of currencies that you can actively trade on

# Ongoing feature :
- Account Informations and balance data screening.

# Future features
Slowly but surely, I will integrate all the API's functions (they aren't so many!)
I'll also add a way to know when to consolidate / sell assets (customizable, so each can have his own strategy).
